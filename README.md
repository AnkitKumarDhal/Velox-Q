## Installation

### Prerequisites

Velox-Q is primarily intended for an Arch Linux + Hyprland environment.

The installer handles the core packages required by Velox-Q, along with the AUR packages and native helper build required by the current shell.

Some optional features may rely on additional system services or applications already present on the system.

### Core Dependencies

| Dependency      | Purpose                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `git`           | Repository management         |
| `rust`          | Native helper builds          |
| Hyprland        | Wayland compositor            |
| Quickshell-git  | Shell framework               |
| Qt6             | UI framework                  |
| Matugen         | Dynamic color generation      |
| PipeWire        | Audio                         |
| WirePlumber     | PipeWire session management   |
| `cliphist`      | Clipboard history             |
| `wl-clipboard`  | Clipboard integration         |
| `brightnessctl` | Brightness management         |
| `awww`          | Wallpaper application         |
| `pywal16`       | Wallpaper and color support   |
| `imagemagick`   | Wallpaper metadata and thumbnails|

Depending on the features you use, additional system packages or services may be required for:

* Bluetooth
* Session management
* Polkit authentication
* Hardware monitoring

Power and battery management is handled separately by the installer when a battery is detected.

### Install

The installer is the recommended way to install Velox-Q.

#### Installer

Run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnkitKumarDhal/Velox-Q/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:

* Install required system packages
* Install or bootstrap an AUR helper when necessary
* Install the required AUR packages
* Verify the wallpaper backend dependencies
* Install Velox-Q into `~/.config/quickshell`
* Back up an existing non-Velox-Q configuration to `~/.config/quickshell.bak`
* Update an existing Velox-Q installation in place
* Build the native Velox-Q battery backend
* Detect battery and power-management capabilities
* Configure TLP and `tlp-pd` when appropriate
* Configure the required Velox-Q sudoers permissions when TLP charging control is available

The installer does not install or configure power-management software on systems without a battery.

#### Updating

Running the same installer command again will update an existing Velox-Q installation in place.

When the repository is already up to date, the installer avoids rebuilding the native battery backend unnecessarily.

The installer will stop if the existing Velox-Q installation contains local Git changes. Commit or stash those changes before updating.

When `~/.config/quickshell` exists but is not recognized as a Velox-Q Git installation, the installer preserves it by moving it to:

```text
~/.config/quickshell.bak
```

If that backup path already exists, a timestamped backup path is created instead.

#### Power Management

Power-management setup is performed only when a battery is detected.

The installer respects an already-active power-management backend.

The current selection behavior is:

```text
TLP active
    → use TLP and ensure tlp-pd is available

power-profiles-daemon active
    → leave the existing backend unchanged

TLP installed but inactive
    → enable TLP and tlp-pd

power-profiles-daemon installed but inactive
    → enable power-profiles-daemon

neither installed
    → install TLP and tlp-pd
```

Systems without a battery skip this setup entirely.

#### TLP Charging Privileges

When TLP is active and a battery exposes the supported `charge_types` interface, the installer creates:

```text
/etc/sudoers.d/velox-q
```

The generated rule is restricted to the charging operations required by Velox-Q.

The sudoers configuration is validated with `visudo` before it is installed.

The installer manages only `/etc/sudoers.d/velox-q`; unrelated sudoers configuration is not modified.

#### Manual Installation

The installer is the recommended installation method.

Manual installation is mainly intended for users who want to inspect or modify the configuration themselves.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnkitKumarDhal/Velox-Q.git
```

2. Copy the configuration into your Quickshell directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/quickshell
cp -r Velox-Q/* ~/.config/quickshell/
```

3. Install the main dependencies on Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S git rust hyprland qt6-base qt6-declarative pipewire wireplumber wl-clipboard cliphist imagemagick brightnessctl awww
```

4. Install the required AUR packages:

```bash
yay -S quickshell-git matugen-bin python-pywal16
```

5. Build the native battery backend:

```bash
cd ~/.config/quickshell/tools/battery/velox-battery
cargo build --release
mkdir -p ../bin
install -m 755 target/release/velox-battery ../bin/velox-battery
```

6. Start the shell:

```bash
quickshell
```

7. Add the Quickshell template to your Matugen configuration:

```toml
[templates.quickshell]
input_path  = "~/.config/quickshell/src/theme/quickshell.json.hbs"
output_path = "~/.config/quickshell/src/theme/Colors.json"
```

8. Generate the colors from your wallpaper:

```bash
matugen image /path/to/wallpaper.jpg
```

9. Add Quickshell to your Hyprland startup configuration:

```hyprlang
exec-once = quickshell
```

Or, when using the Lua version of Hyprland:

```lua
hl.exec_cmd("quickshell")
```

The exact configuration syntax may differ depending on how your Hyprland configuration is structured.

## Known Issues

* Fullscreen-aware bar visibility can still depend on Hyprland's fullscreen state reporting and the compositor configuration.

* Notification toast animation and stacking may require additional visual tuning, especially when several notifications arrive in rapid succession.

* Currency conversion requires network access when a cached exchange rate is unavailable. This is an optional (turned on by default) online feature rather than a required shell dependency.

---

## Core Components

### Module System

The top bar is divided into three module groups.

#### Left

* Arch Linux entry
* System monitor
* Workspace switcher

#### Center

* Clock and date
* Idle inhibition
* Media indicator

#### Right

* Battery
* Network
* Notifications
* System tray
* Volume

The modules are intentionally kept focused on presentation and interaction, with system-level functionality handled by the service layer.

### Popup System

The shell provides dedicated popups for the major interactive features.

* Application launcher
* Clipboard manager
* Emoji picker
* Wallpaper selector
* Media controls
* Network controls
* Volume controls
* System monitor
* Battery controls
* Calendar
* Caffeine
* Session manager
* Keybind viewer
* Polkit authentication
* Notifications

Shared popup components provide consistent animation, layout, dismissal, and styling.

### Service System

Services handle the system-facing and persistent parts of the shell.

* Battery
* Bluetooth
* Brightness
* Caffeine
* Clipboard
* Keybinds
* Launcher
* Unit and currency conversion
* Media
* Network
* Notifications
* Polkit
* Session
* Volume
* CPU
* Memory
* GPU
* Disk
* Network statistics
* Thermal statistics

This keeps system interaction separate from the visual QML components.

### State Management

Global shell state is centralized in two main singleton files.

#### `ShellState.qml`

Handles:

* Bar visibility
* Fullscreen behavior
* Manual hide/show behavior
* Fullscreen visibility override
* Top-bar layout information

#### `Popups.qml`

Handles:

* Popup visibility
* Popup coordination
* Popup mutual exclusion
* Network tab state
* Aggregate popup-open state
* Closing all open popups

---

## Keybindings

Keybindings are defined in `shell.qml` using Quickshell's `GlobalShortcut` component.

### Available Global Actions

| Shortcut Name           | Action                         | Handler                             | Description                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `focusModeToggle`       | Toggle fullscreen bar override | `ShellState.toggleManualOverride()` | Changes bar visibility behavior in fullscreen |
| `barHideToggle`         | Toggle bar visibility          | `ShellState.toggleManualHide()`     | Manually hides/shows the bar                  |
| `launcherToggle`        | Toggle launcher                | `Popups.launcherOpen`               | Opens/closes launcher                         |
| `clipboardToggle`       | Toggle clipboard manager       | `Popups.clipboardOpen`              | Opens/closes clipboard popup                  |
| `emojiPickerToggle`     | Toggle emoji picker            | `Popups.emojiOpen`                  | Opens/closes emoji popup                      |
| `mediaPlayerPopup`      | Toggle media popup             | `Popups.mediaOpen`                  | Opens/closes media controls                   |
| `wallpaperPickerToggle` | Toggle wallpaper picker        | `Popups.wallpaperOpen`              | Opens/closes wallpaper selector               |
| `keybindsToggle`        | Toggle keybind viewer          | `Popups.keybindsOpen`               | Opens/closes keybind viewer                   |
| `sessionToggle`         | Toggle session manager         | `Popups.sessionOpen`                | Opens/closes session popup                    |

### Common Default Bindings

```text
SUPER + X
    Toggle bar visibility

SUPER + Space
    Toggle launcher

SUPER + V
    Toggle clipboard manager
```

Additional keybindings can be mapped in the Hyprland configuration.

For a Lua-based Hyprland configuration:

```lua
local mainMod = "SUPER"

hl.bind(mainMod .. " + X", hl.dsp.global("quickshell:barHideToggle"))
hl.bind(mainMod .. " + SPACE", hl.dsp.global("quickshell:launcherToggle"))
hl.bind(mainMod .. " + V", hl.dsp.global("quickshell:clipboardToggle"))
```

---

## Configuration

### Launcher

The launcher supports the following syntax:

```text
> command
? web search
!g google search
!s startpage search
```

Examples:

```text
> htop
? how does Wayland work
!g Quickshell documentation
!s Linux news
```

Calculator examples:

```text
2 + 2
sqrt(144)
sin(30)
2^10
```

Unit conversion examples:

```text
10 km to mi
100 kmh to mph
2 gb to mb
```

Currency conversion examples:

```text
100 USD to INR
50 EUR to USD
```

Currency conversion is optional (turned on by default) and requires online exchange-rate access when no cached rate is available.

The default web search engine can be customized through:

```bash
export LAUNCHER_SEARCH_URL="https://www.google.com/search?q="
```

### Clipboard Manager

The clipboard manager can be customized through its service and popup components.

The available categories are:

```text
All
Text
Images
Links
Code
Pinned
```

Clipboard state is persisted using Quickshell's state storage, while image and search data use the Quickshell cache directory.

### Wallpaper Selector

The wallpaper picker can browse a configured directory and rescan it directly from the popup.

Wallpaper-related customization is primarily contained within:

```text
src/popups/wallpaper/
```

The wallpaper directory defaults to:

```text
~/wallpapers/
```

### Theme

Theme generation is handled through Matugen and Pywal16.

Generate a new theme from a wallpaper:

```bash
matugen image /path/to/wallpaper.jpg
```

The generated colors are written to:

```text
~/.config/quickshell/src/theme/Colors.json
```

### Environment

The launcher can optionally use:

```bash
LAUNCHER_SEARCH_URL
```

to change the default web search endpoint.
